// ## I. Variables & Datatypes

// ### A. Q + A

// 1. How do we assign a value to a variable? 
var variable1 = 'value1'
console.log(variable1);
// 2. How do we change the value of a variable? 
var variable1 = 'value2'
console.log(variable1);
// 3. How do we assign an existing variable to a new variable?
var variable2 = variable1
console.log(variable2);
// 4. Remind me, what are `declare`, `assign`, and `define`?

'declare is to create a new variable name'

'assign is when you give it a variable'

'define is when you create a new variable and assign it a value '

// 5. What is pseudocoding and why should you do it?
'When you write out the solution to a problem by iusing english words instead of the language syntax. It helps you plan out what you are supposed to be doing without worring about that exact syntax to use.'

// 6. What percentage of time should be spent thinking about how you're going to solve a problem vs actually typing in code to solve it?

'70/30?'
